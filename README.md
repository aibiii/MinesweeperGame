# MinesweeperGame

The project was created on Apache NetBeans 16. 
So, the code contains specific location of "image" folder (specified in Board.java file).

If images are not working for any reason, it's because of the file location.
Depending on the program you are trying to run this code, the location of images has to be changed.

Moreover, the project is not fully finished. The only part I was unable to complete is expanding the spaces
on the grid layout until cell meets a another cell with digit. Other parts are complete.
